           Id attributes are used to uniquely identify a tag from another tag. We can access a tag by its id via "#" before its name.It can be used both for css styling and for linking to a specific within the same website.
        </p>
        <p id="02">Block Elements or Block-level Elements, are those  elements which always on a new line and take the entire block, means they take the entire width of their place even if its remain empty. We can also adjust their margin, padding, height, and width. Examples are p, all the heading tags, div,ul and li. </p>
     </div>
     <div>
        <p class="inline">
            Class attributes are like labels. You can give the same class name to group elements logically. We can access them through "." before its name. It can be used for styling or JavaScript purposes. You can also assign a single element multiple class names like: div class="card featured shadow">div.And Each class is seperated by a space.
        </p>
        <p class="inline">
            Inline Elements are elements that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They Flow within the content, like words in a paragraph. We cannot access height, width, margin, and padding of Inline Elements by default. Examples are Examples: span, a, strong, em, img, and s.>
        </p>   
    </div>
    <p class="inline block">There's also a hybrid type called "inline-block" elements, which flow like inline elements but respect width, height, margins, and padding like block elements.</p>

        <h2>Div:</h2>
        <p>Div, a block-level element, is used when when you want group set of elements in a block level box. Dv is an essential element of html becase it is used to make boundaries that are used to build the structure of the webpage.We can also use Div for further styling of the webpage.It is also used to create sections within a webpage.It can contain both Block-level and inline elements.</p>
        <h2>Span:</h2>
        <p>Span, an Inline element, is also used for grouping element, but used for styling or targeting small pieces of content inside a block. Span cannot contain block-levl elements,but can contain inline or plain text.</p>
        <h2>Don't use them:</h2>
        <h3>Don't Abuse Them </h3>
        <p> Don't use div or span when there's a semantic alternative available (section, article, strong, em, etc.)</p>
        <p>They're meant to be genericâ€”so use them only when nothing more meaningful fits the job.</p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <div style="background-color: lightblue"><p>This is a div.</p></div>
        <p>This is is a <span style="background-color: lightblue">span.</span></p>
